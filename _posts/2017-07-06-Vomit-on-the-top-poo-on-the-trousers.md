Thursday 13th April, 12 whole weeks ago, was my last day at work.  When I say work I mean my job in London. It was also my last day of what I'm used to, getting up, commuting, working, accomplishing things, using my mind, working out problems and for the most part accomplishing things. Yes I meant to say that last part twice and by accomplishing things I mean simple things too, you know, like going out in clean clothes.

It all started when someone mentioned the new shared maternity leave policy at work.  Our company has introduced 18 weeks of full paid shared maternity leave. That is on top of the 2 weeks paternity leave you get normally.

To get this shared maternity leave you effectively take a portion of the benefits your partner gets which of course means they must be eligible for such things. In my instance it means Suzanna would lose 18 weeks of maternity allowance which is comparable to my commuting costs so in essence was a no brainer.  If she was still working full-time then it would not have made financial sense and it would have cut her leave down as well so wouldn't have been an option, well definitely not for all 18 weeks!

So I thought what an opportunity! Take the leave and have an epic summer with the family while doing some of those jobs  that need doing. Do lots of gardening, paint and decorate the house, start those wood working projects, practice my photography and finally start running regularly. How very naive.

We already have a gorgeous baby boy, who's actually 2 and a quarter and is more of a little boy, but will always be our baby! First time around I did the 2 weeks leave, then back to work. I thought those first 2 weeks were tough and I knew it was difficult for my wife especially after I returned to work, there were bad times but of course that's all normal, it's difficult with a newborn and I did my best to run home and take care of them.

This time around being exposed to a new born permanently I can honestly say I was wrong, it's not difficult, it's the hardest thing I've ever done. Relentless is the best word I can come up with. Just when you think you can't take anymore you have to. There is little to no free time. Our days are made up of caring for our little boy (cooking, playing, entertaining, bathing, answering a billion questions, reading etc) and he needs it. He's so hungry for stimulation and takes everything in then makes it his own, it's amazing to see. That's the easy one.

Then you have our new beautiful daughter. At the same time as trying to care for him we have this wonderful bundle of joy that can go from beaming smiles to abject rage in under a second. She's fantastic at torture, giving us a 6 hour sleep and light at the end of the tunnel, then insisting on only sleep on you or waking every 40 minutes screaming. Or just being wide awake and smiling for an hour between 3:30 and 4:30pm. Everything is random, the pattern of life you are used to is no more. You're not in control of what and when you do things.

You try and make plans, not big ones, just to pop into town first thing to get a haircut. Let's just achieve that shall we? Only it doesn't happen. You wake up tired, you're close to the end of your tether already. You were up with the baby helping feeding, she fed for a total of 7 minutes, but that took an hour and a half. She vomited, pooed and needed cleaning. She takes ten minutes to burp and as she has reflux you have to keep her up for 30 minutes otherwise you'll have to change her cot and possibly your own bedding! She's still screaming, you tentatively ask your tired and exhausted wife to try feeding, only to see and hear your daughter scream louder and see your wife break a little as the one thing that should always comfort her antagonises her further. This of course wakes the boy, he's lovely, wants a cuddle, another 10 minutes gone. You watch him on the monitor wide awake and know he's going to be tired the next day. That means he's going to have a short fuse and guarantees things will be harder tomorrow…. Eventually everyone is settled and you can doze off to sleep at 5am.

Waking at 5:30 to your daughter crying, some wind must have been left as she's arching her back….

I had plans for the next day, hopes of doing more than just surviving and making sure the kids are ok. Wanted to read a book maybe. It's not fair. Resentment builds. Guilt builds too, this time is so special how can I be resentful!?

And repeat

It's so so hard.

Having this time at home and not having the respite of going to a paid job everyday has given me a new found respect for my wife. I already knew she was awesome, but she's proper hardcore. She's stunning, even after getting ready to go out in her last remaining clothes that seem to fit as her body recovers from the trauma of birth, realising the trousers have a poo stain on from sometime earlier that week and losing her top to vomit from the last feed. She still hangs in there, doesn't take it out on the kids and still keeps going when I most definitely couldn't.
